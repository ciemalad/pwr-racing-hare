# Pathfinding
## Overview and purpose
Main purpose of the program is to find the shortest path from node marked as 'z' to node 'n' moving only on nodes marked as '.', avoiding nodes 'x' and to give number of movest required to get to the end.
Moving pattern looks like knight's pattern from chess:
- x+1, y+2
- x+1, y-2
- x+2, y+1
- x+2, y-1
- x-1, y+2
- x-1, y-2
- x-2, y+1
- x-2, y-1
